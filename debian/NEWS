xmlto (0.0.20-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This new upstream version adds support for the docbook-xsl/fop toolchain
  via the --with-fop switch. Because passivetex is still missing from the
  Debian archive and will probably never come back, use it to create PDF or
  PS output. DVI output is still broken! But we are working on dblatex support
  which will be available as of upstream version 0.0.21 or in
  Debian/experimental soon.
