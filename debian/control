Description: XML-to-any converter
 xmlto is a front-end to an XSL toolchain. It chooses an appropriate
 stylesheet for the conversion you want and applies it using an external
 XSLT processor (currently, only xsltproc is supported). It also performs
 any necessary post-processing.
 .
 It supports converting from DocBook XML to DVI, XSL-FO, HTML and XHTML
 (one or multiple pages), epub, manual page, PDF, PostScript and plain
 text. It also supports converting from XSL-FO to DVI, PDF and PostScript.
 .
 DVI output requires dblatex or PassiveTeX. Other formats can be produced
 with any of the supported toolchains - dblatex, PassiveTeX or
 docbook-xsl/fop (but may require some extensions).
